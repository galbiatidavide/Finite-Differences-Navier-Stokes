\label{classadvection}\index{advection@{advection}}


Solves the Advection Diffusion evolutionary incompressible equations. It consists of a transport problem for each velocity component and a parabolic problem for each velocity component. Current implementation allows Dirichlet bc\textquotesingle{}s only. Boundary conditions are accessed from reference solution, which is a function of space and time. Current implementation allows for Brinkamn penalty method.
