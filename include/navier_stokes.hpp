 * @class navier_stokes_problem

 * It consists of a transport problem for each velocity component, a parabolic problem for each velocity component, and a Poisson problem for the pressure.
 * Current implementation allows Dirichlet bc's only. Boundary conditions are accessed from reference solution, which is a function of space and time.
 * Current implementation allows for Brinkamn penalty method.
