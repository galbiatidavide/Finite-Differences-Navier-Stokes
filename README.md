# Finite Differences Navier-Stokes Solver

This project implements a solver based on finite differences for the Navier-Stokes equations. The solver is designed to handle multiple physics problems, with the final goal of solving Brinkman flow for a generic geometry. It allows computations on a default cubic domain as well as on an input mesh using the Brinkman penalization method.

Our multiphysics solver is capable of solving a variety of problems, including Navier-Stokes and parabolic problems. This flexibility enables a broad range of simulations in fluid dynamics.

## **Requirements**

To compile and run the project, make sure you have the following tools and libraries installed and configured:

- **Compiler**: GCC with C++20 support
- **Libraries**:
  - PETSc
  - VTK
  - Eigen

---

## **Installation**

1. **Load the required modules**:  
   Before compiling or running the program, load the necessary modules. Ensure that your environment is correctly set up by running:
   ```bash
   source /u/sw/etc/bash.bashrc
   module load gcc-glibc
   module load eigen
   module load vtk
   module load petsc
   ```

2. **Compile the project**:
    After loading the modules, compile the project by running:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

3. **Usage**
    To run the solver, execute the following command:
    ```bash
    ./bin/main
    ```
    For the Brinkman solver, the name of the `.stl` file must be specified. An example mesh is provided. To run the solver on the example mesh, execute the following command:
    ```bash
    ./bin/main caroitd.stl
    ```
    The program will compute the solution and store the results in the `results` directory.

## **Simulation Examples**
Below are some example simulations generated by our solver:
